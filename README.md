# React hook lazy loading pattern demo

Simple demo app for a hooks pattern. You should really check out the accompanying blog post.
The two most relevant files to the blog post are `src/TabData.tsx` and `src/useTabeData.ts`. This repo is in typescript while the snippets in the blog post are regular react-js (sorry).

Normal create-react-app scripts to start this `yarn start`/`npm start`
